## Talk on &ldquo;Genetics of extreme body size evolution in mice from Gough Island&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I will give at
[St Olaf College](https://stolaf.edu) on 30 Sept 2019.
(They are revised from a talk I gave at the
[Madison East High School](https://east.madison.k12.wi.us) on 9 March
2017, which were revised from slides for a talk at the
[Complex Trait Community 13th annual meeting](http://www.ctc2014.org) in
Berlin, Germany, on 21 May 2014.)
